There is a box defined by the following dimensions:
box_x - width of box, in pixels
box_y - height of box, in pixels

text_object - an object for text data and several methods
text_object.text_str - Some arbitrary text. It can be any length of characters.
text_object.setfontsize(fontsize) - A method with one parameter to set the fontsize in points of the text_str.
text_object.check_text_dimensions() - A method which returns the height and width in pixels of the text_str using the current font size

What I would like you to do is to write code that determines which font size to use so that the 
text is as large as it can be but still fit in the box with dimensions box_x,box_y.

After you have done this, you can presume the following exists:

text_object.setfontsize(12) - Fontsize has been set to 12
text_object.scale(a,b) - A method which takes two arguments, one for scaling the width value, one for scaling the
height value of text_object.text_str.

Write the code that will figure out and implement the scaling necessary for the text to fit in the box best.

The above tasks are sort of assuming that the box is a long rectangle. However, what if it is more squarish? 
The best text then would be not only resized appropriately, 
but also wrapped to fill the vertical space. The next task would then be to write...

text_object.wrap_and_scale(x,y) - A method that uses the above code to scale and wrap the text so that it best fits
in a box of width x and height y. The wrapping should be done on whitespace.

You can use whatever language you like. I just need to be able to see the code as well as to run it.
